    "1- Use an simulator model (i.e., LLM) to generate attacks for each vulnerability type (sub-categories of a particular vulnerability). By default, OpenAI models are used to simulate the attacks. To simulate the attacks, different prompts per vulnerability type are designed. These prompts are pre-defined. However, it is possible to personnalize the generated attacks by providing a `purpose` that better describes your usecase. \n",
    "\n",
    "2- Prompt the agent with the generated attacks to collect the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Evaluate the agent's responses based on the vulnerability type and output a score between 0 and 1.\n",

    "- **Prompt-based jailbreaks**: Include the different strategies and templates to generate an adversarial prompt. The generated prompt is usually fixed and does not evolve. This category includes: persuasion, role-playing, in-context malicious demonstration, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gradient-based jailbreaks**: involve multi-step optimization process to revise one unsafe prompt using the gradient of the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM-based jailbreaks**: This is when an attacker LLM is used to refine and enhance the adversarial prompt. LLMs can also be used to evaluate the targeted agent’s response to further enhance the malicious prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prompt Injection Attacks:\n",
    "When an attacker manipulated the prompt to make them generate specific outputs that are usually out of the unintended use. This includes goal hijacking and prompt leaking. These attacks can be direct or indirect. Direct prompt injection directly provide the malicious prompt to the target LLM/agent. Indirect prompt injection hides the malicious prompt in external data like retrieved documents that the LLM/agent will ingest. \n",

       "\n",
       "If you want technical detail\n",
       "- I can explain: model architectures at a high level (transformers), training phases (pretraining, supervised \n",

       "High-level phased plan (ethical, practical version)\n",
       "- Phase 0 — Project setup (1–2 weeks)\n",

       "  - Identify target users, data types, risk profile, and regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).\n",
       "  - Establish governance: appoint a data steward, set up ethics review (IRB or internal), privacy officer, and \n",
       "threat model.\n",
       "  - Create documentation templates: data inventory, model card, datasheet.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Phase 1 — Initiate model development (2–4 weeks)\n",
       "  - Choose model family &amp; baseline architecture appropriate to problem (e.g., classification/regression/seq2seq).\n",
       "  - Define evaluation metrics (primary and secondary — see metrics list below).\n",
       "  - Prepare reproducible experiment environment (version control, containerization, seed management).\n",
       "  - Create initial test harness and CI for training/eval pipelines.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Phase 2 — Initial data collection (2–6 weeks)\n",
       "  - Design data collection plan: scope, sources, consent, retention policy, labeling protocol.\n",
       "  - Use consent-forward collection (explicit informed consent or legally compliant data access).\n",
       "  - Apply minimization: collect only fields required for model performance.\n",
       "  - Log provenance and store metadata (source, acquisition date, access controls).\n",
       "  - Where personal data cannot be used, consider synthetic data generation or public datasets with clear licenses.\n",
       "\n",
       "- Phase 3 — Data quality &amp; relevance analysis (1–3 weeks)\n",
       "  - Run automated data-quality checks: missingness, noise, duplicates, class imbalance, label consistency.\n",
       "  - Perform exploratory data analysis (E[x], distributions, outliers, feature correlations).\n",
       "  - Evaluate representativeness vs target population; identify potential biases and gaps.\n",
       "  - Produce a “data quality report” with suggested remediations (relabeling, augmentation, additional sources).\n",

       "- Phase 4 — Initial training and parameter adjustment (2–6 weeks)\n",
       "  - Train baseline models; log hyperparameters and metrics.\n",

       "  - Monitor training behavior (loss curves, validation drift, overfitting detection).\n",
       "  - Run adversarial and robustness checks (toxic inputs, input perturbations).\n",

       "- Phase 5 — Dataset expansion (ongoing)\n",

       "  - Use targeted data acquisition to fill identified gaps from Phase 3.\n",
       "  - Apply careful deduplication, labeling consistency procedures, and additional QA.\n",
