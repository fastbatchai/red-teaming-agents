    "\n",
    "The vulnerabilities implemented in DeepTeam follow these 3 steps:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1- Use an simulator model (i.e., LLM) to generate attacks for each vulnerability type (sub-categories of a particular vulnerability). By default, OpenAI models are used to simulate the attacks. To simulate the attacks, different prompts per vulnerability type are designed. These prompts are pre-defined. However, it is possible to personnalize the generated attacks by providing a `purpose` that better describes your usecase. \n",
    "\n",
    "2- Prompt the agent with the generated attacks to collect the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- Evaluate the agent's responses based on the vulnerability type and output a score between 0 and 1.\n",

    "#### Jailbreak attacks:\n",
    "Make the LLM generate unsafe content like violence. Jailbreak attacks focus on bypassing the safety rules. There are multiple jailbreak attacks in the litterature that can be categorized in two groups: \n",
    "- **Prompt-based jailbreaks**: Include the different strategies and templates to generate an adversarial prompt. The generated prompt is usually fixed and does not evolve. This category includes: persuasion, role-playing, in-context malicious demonstration, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gradient-based jailbreaks**: involve multi-step optimization process to revise one unsafe prompt using the gradient of the loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM-based jailbreaks**: This is when an attacker LLM is used to refine and enhance the adversarial prompt. LLMs can also be used to evaluate the targeted agent’s response to further enhance the malicious prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prompt Injection Attacks:\n",
    "When an attacker manipulated the prompt to make them generate specific outputs that are usually out of the unintended use. This includes goal hijacking and prompt leaking. These attacks can be direct or indirect. Direct prompt injection directly provide the malicious prompt to the target LLM/agent. Indirect prompt injection hides the malicious prompt in external data like retrieved documents that the LLM/agent will ingest. \n",
